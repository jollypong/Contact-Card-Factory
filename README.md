## Description

This applcation was built for a client who wished to be able to view his team's contact information in one webpage. As his team has a high turn over rate, he wanted to make sure that this application was easily manageable. As a solution, I have created a CLI application that will prompt user and will automatically generate team contact cards for display on the webpage. 

This application was made using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node JS, and NPM Packages.

## Installation

  For Installation, you are required the following:
  - Node JS 
  - Browser of Choice (to display html page)
  
  Additional packages required are: 
  - Node Packet Manager(NPM):
    - NPM [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
    - NPM [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
    - NPM [File System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-system)

  You can install the above required packages by entering following on the terminal/node: 
  ```
    npm init -y 
    npm install
    npm i inquirer
    npm i jest
  ```
